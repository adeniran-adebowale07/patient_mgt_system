A fully functional backend system that:
● Manages data efficiently with proper database structures.
● Implements authentication and authorization for security.
● Handles API requests for seamless frontend communication.
● Ensures scalability and performance using best practices.

Problem Statement:
Hospitals and clinics struggle with efficient patient record management, appointment scheduling, and prescription tracking.

Project Scope:
● Develop a RESTful API for managing patient records.
● Implement user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) (e.g., doctors, nurses, admins).
● Store electronic medical records (EMRs) securely using encryption.
● Set up an appointment scheduling API with real-time availability updates.

Key Deliverables:
● Database schema for patient records (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
● API endpoints for CRUD operations on patient data.
● JWT-based authentication for user roles.
● Integration with a frontend or mobile app.
